## Introduction:
<p id="description">This repository contains a simple proxy server implemented using Node.js, Express, and the http-proxy library. The proxy server receives requests from clients, handles API requests, and returns responses. It can be configured to forward requests to a specified API server.</p>

Here're some of the project's best features:

- **Proxy Middleware:** Middleware to intercept requests and forward them to a specified API server.
- **Logging:** Detailed logging of incoming requests and successful forwarding.
- **Error Handling:** Graceful handling of errors during the proxying process.
